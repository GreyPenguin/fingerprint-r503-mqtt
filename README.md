# Fingerprint - R503

## What is this?

This a firmware for arduino like devices with integrated WIFI adapter, based on ESP8266 board, like the [Wemos D1 Mini](https://amzn.to/3fP5Pir).

Connect one of these board to a [R503 Fingerprint capacitive sensor](https://amzn.to/31WWdd6) and you can send commands via MQTT protocol to an IoT hub.

This project is made with Home Assistant integration in mind, but it can be used to only interact with any MQTT broker.

## Features
* Simple configuration via WIFI
* Detect different users and different user's fingerprints
* Detect fingerprint mismatch
* Add and delete fingerprints via MQTT
* Led color code feedback
* Led signalling via MQTT

Home Assistant can use messages to enable automations and trigger things like:

* Open a door using electric locks
* Enable/disable alarm system using different fingerprints
* Enable/disable access based on user and/or time
* Activate notificatons on unknown fingerprint

## What do you need?

### Hardware

1. Home Assistant with MQTT broker running (or another MQTT broker running on your LAN)
2. A fingerprint sensor model [R503](https://amzn.to/31WWdd6)
3. An ESP8266 board like the [Wemos D1 mini](https://amzn.to/3fP5Pir)

### Software

Interaction will be done sending/receiving MQTT messages to a borker. Most used broker is called Mosquitto and can be installed as Home Assistant integration.

## How to

### Connections
<img src="doc/connections.jpg" width="650">

* Red cable on 3.3 volt
* Black cable on ground
* Green cable on pin D5
* Yellow cable on pin D6

The other 2 sensor cables can be left unused.

### Flash

This project is not made using standard Arduino IDE. It's a PlatformIO project.

Connect the Wemos to a usb port and:

* Linux (and maybe Mac): type `$ ./install_into_usb_connected_wemos_d1.sh` (python3 and curl are needed)
* Windows: I don't know. Follow PlatformIO docs to flash under Windows machines.

### Configure

After flash and reboot, when no configuration is found the Wemos will tun on a WiFi network called "Fingerprint-Setup":

Use a mobile phone or PC to connect to that WiFi network. A configuration page will popup:

Fill in all required fields:

* SSID name of your WiFi network
* WiFi password
* MQTT host: broker hostname or IP (use Home Assistant address if you are using it's Mosquitto add-on)
* MQTT port: broker port (usually 1883)
* MQTT username (configure an user in Mosquitto or let it be got from Home Assistant users)
* MQTT password (the password)
* Gate name: the name of *this* sensor (to distinguish from other devices on the same broker)

NB: do NOT use any special chars in the gate name field: only letters and numbers, no spaces or other things.

After saving, Wemos will reboot and will try to connect to WiFi network. On successful, it will flash blue led on sensor.

### Reset

If you mistyped some data or you want to reset device, do:

* tun on device
* wait 10 seconds
* press the reset button
* wait 5 seconds
* press again reset button

Device will reboot in config mode and Fingerprint-Setup WiFi network will come back again.

NB: reset will *NOT* reset any registered fingerprints on the sensor.

## Integration

Everything will be controlled sending and receiving MQTT messages. If you are using Home Assistant you can both send and receive messages in:

**Configuration -> Integration -> MQTT - CONFIGURE**

Then you can set topic to send to json messages, and topic to listen to for incoming messages.

Topics must include the given *gate* name, following this table:


| Topic                           | Direction | Purpose                                     |
|---------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| /fingerprint/[gate]/**status**  | incoming  | Current sensor status and messages          |
| /fingerprint/[gate]/**learn**   | outgoing  | Start the learning new fingerprint process  |
| /fingerprint/[gate]/**delete**  | outgoing  | Delete a previous learned fingerprint       |

For example, if gate is "main":
